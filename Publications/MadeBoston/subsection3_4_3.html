Composition editing and playback is the mechanism within MADE for
developing and viewing multimedia/hypermedia documents, both from the
point of view of an author of such documents and also from the point of
view of the final user(s) of a MADE application based on the document
concept.  The composition editing and playback utility is one of the main
integrating components of the MADE application environment. It is
through the definition of an abstract document structure that a
hypermedia document is created and it is the presentation of this
hyperdocument which the end user may interact with. During both the
authoring and playback modes of operation the composition utility makes
direct use of the other MADE utilities for viewing or editing
particular media objects, for presenting help information, for
navigating the hyperdocument structure, and perhaps also for monitoring
the user's actions. The composition utility drives the operation of
these other utilities based on a composition graph (ie, the internal
representation of the hyperdocument).
<P>
An essential aspect of the composition facilities is the ability
to define and manipulate an abstract document structure<A NAME=tex2html7 HREF=Descrhtml.foot.html#314><IMG ALIGN=MIDDLE SRC="http://www.cwi.nl/latex2html-icons/foot_motif.gif"></A> The abstract document structure is a
representation of logical components which describes not only the
specific types of media involved in the presentation, but also the
semantic connections between media, the synchronisation constraints
associated with the presentation of the logical components, geometric
and other presentation attributes for each component, and specific
interaction entities to be used in reading the multimedia document.
<P>
The authoring and presentation of a hyperdocument is not only determined
by the media and the composition utilities. There may be a number of
alternative styles (or metaphors) for presenting a particular
hyperdocument that are dependent not on the specific document itself but
on the application domain in which the MADE application exists.
<P>
A specific goal of the composition utilities of MADE as a whole is
to separate the presentation metaphor used for authoring and viewing a
MADE hyperdocument from the underlying composition graph.  The aim is
to accommodate different styles of authoring and different forms of
visually structuring the hypermedia information. Within the MADE
project, a prototype authoring application will be developed, with a
specific application area and presentation metaphor. However, this
application should be considered merely as a test of the MADE
concepts; it is perfectly possible for another application to choose a
radically different presentation scheme and implement it on the ``top''
of the MADE composition utilities.
<P>
Another important aspect of the composition editing and playback
facility is making provision for use of an interchange format that
represents the abstract document structure in a more persistent form.
An interchange format enables the reuse of existing compositions, either
fully or in part, and enables the exchange of documents among MADE 
applications. This aspect is not straightforward, however, and there are
a number of decisions to be made on which specific format should be
adopted. The main contenders at the moment appear to be
HyTime<A HREF=bibliography3_8.html#HyTime>[13]</A> and MHEG<A HREF=bibliography3_8.html#MHEG>[14]</A>. A third choice would
be to develop a MADE specific format (temporarily denoted as MIFF), perhaps based partly on either of the above or some other less
well known format. Other possibilities include the Microsoft's AVI format (<A HREF=bibliography3_8.html#AVI>[21]</A>) and the MOVIE format defines as part
of Apple's QuickTime environment (<A HREF=bibliography3_8.html#MOVIE>[32]</A>). At the time of writing,
the choice of the appropriate format is still to be made.
<P>
The composition utilities include some sub-modules with well specified
tasks. These include:
<P>
An <em>interaction editor</em>, used to create or modify interaction
objects (see &#167;<A HREF=subsubsection3_3_2_4.html#secinteraction>3.2.4</A>). This involves defining sensors
associated with MADE objects (or with their associated visual
metaphor), specifying the objects the interaction object has to control,
and editing the corresponding script. The definition and/or the
modification of sensors may involve, eg, graphics editing, which means
that the interaction editor may also start up a 2D graphics editor
internally. In this setting, interaction objects provide a possible
internal representation for hyperlinks.
<P>
The role of the <em>synchronization editor</em> is to interactively
define the synchronization patterns among several synchronizable MADE
objects. This may involve the specification of reference points, setting
references of other object the synchronizable object has to synchronize
with, defining the details of this synchronization, etc.  Time objects
are also managed by this editor; the user may indeed prefer to use the
notions of time, scheduler, and time-constraints for the purpose of
synchronization, rather than the concept of reference points. (As
described in &#167;<A HREF=subsubsection3_3_2_3.html#secsynchronization>3.2.3</A>, both mechanisms are available
within the MADE toolkit.)
<P>
The choice of the interchange format will greatly influence whether, in
the synchronization editor, the emphasis will be placed on reference point
on time-based synchronization. HyTime, for example, expresses
all synchronizations using an abstract notion of time; quite naturally,
if the HyTime format, or a subset of it, is chosen, this will
determine the final shape of the synchronization editor, too.
<P>
The <em>graph</em> or <em>layout editor</em> gives a visual interface for the
direct manipulation and visualization of the composition graph (ie, the
hyperdocument structure).
<P>
Finally, the <em>composition editor</em> is the most complex composition
utility, which combines and controls all other composition utilities as
well as the monomedia editors, and MADE toolkit objects. It is this
module which lies at the heart of all composition utilities, which
is responsible for providing all the general functionalities described
above.
