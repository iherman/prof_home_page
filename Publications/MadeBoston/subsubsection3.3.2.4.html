Multimedia applications are very often highly interactive; it is
therefore essential to give very good tools to construct complex
interaction scenarios involving  MADE objects.
<P>
The  MADE project does <em> not</em> aim at developing a completely new
user interface management system. Instead,  MADE objects may be
embedded into an existing user interface environment, like the Athena
Widget set of X Window System, the Motif toolkit, MS-Windows or, in the
future, Windows--NT. Nevertheless, not all user interaction can be adequately
managed by these tools; many complex interaction scenarios will involve
 MADE objects directly (eg, for direct manipulation).  The scheme
developed in  MADE for achieving these complex interaction scenarios
is based on the notion of <em> sensors</em> and associated <em>
interaction objects</em>.
<P>
Sensors are best understood in the context of graphics: in this context
they define sensitive areas on the screen, which can be ``activated'' by
external interaction, typically mouse events.  Sensors are associated
with  MADE objects via interaction objects. In effect, they provide a
sensitive region which acts as a focal point for interaction with these
objects.  For some objects, sensors cannot be attached to the object
itself, but, instead, a visual representation of the object is used, in
the form of graphics object. This might be the case, for some sensors
attached to audio objects. The notion of sensor is general enough to
accommodate regions involving higher dimensions including time. It can
also be applied in association with interaction input devices that
provide non--geometric input measures, such as audio input devices,
pressure sensitive devices, etc.

<P>
Sensors forward events to interaction objects; it is part of the
sensor's initialization procedure to decide which interaction object
it is connected to. The interaction objects react on these events,
following some patterns which describes the behaviour of the
interaction object. Several sensors may be connected to the same
interaction object.
<P>
In very simple cases, interaction objects perform straightforward and
predefined tasks (like, for example, reshaping a graphics object).  In
other cases, much greater complexity may be required, perhaps providing
control over several  MADE objects and receiving events from several
sensors (eg, the video control board depicted in Figure <A HREF=subsection3.3.2.html#figwindow>2</A>
reacts on the sensors of the graphical objects describing the four
push--buttons, may control the visual appearance of these buttons and,
of course, controls the video object proper; see also
Figure <A HREF=subsubsection3.3.2.4.html#figinteract>4</A>). To describe such complex interaction
behaviour,  MADE introduces a type of interaction object that
implements a general finite state machine (see <A HREF=bibliography3.8.html#MADEIAO>[11]</A>). These
objects have a default finite state machine for a specific interaction
scenario; however, the user can also assign a script to an interaction
object, which, conceptually, includes a complete scripting interpreter
(see also &#167;<A HREF=subsubsection3.4.1.2.html#secscripting>4.1.2</A>). Such a script automatically overrides
the default behaviour of the interaction object. This high degree of
openness, with respect to the end--user, is a very valuable feature of
the  MADE interaction management.
