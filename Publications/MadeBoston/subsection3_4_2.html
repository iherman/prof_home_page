The role of monomedia editors is relatively straightforward: they offer
means for the creation, modification, and also for the display of media
objects. There is nothing particularly unusual or new in these
utilities, except that they all abide to the architectural demands for
MADE editors, as described above. Note that these editors make
use of the visual metaphors described in &#167;<A HREF=subsubsection3_4_1_1.html#secvisuals>4.1.1</A> to give a
unified outlook.
<P>
MADE editor objects may be used in various application settings. This
includes being activated alongside with other MADE objects, eg, other
editors. In this case, editor objects may be active objects, and the
mechanism provided by the MADE object model will ensure that data
managed by several editors will not be corrupted by concurrent access.
Editors may also be wrapped up into separate application programs to run
as stand-alone processes. In this case, editors may operate on MADE
objects residing in a database or they can manage objects received via a
communication channel using, eg, the KEDIT protocol
(see &#167;<A HREF=section3_2.html#sectechnoverview>2</A>).
<P>
The <em>2D graphics editor</em> is based on an existing program, called
<tt>godraw</tt> (related to GoPATH, mentioned earlier).  The facilities
supported by this editor are relatively straightforward, and are in line
with other 2D graphics editors, available for different platforms.
<P>
The <em>3D graphics editor</em> emphasizes two aspects of 3D editing:
editing of scenes by composing 3D objects in space, and simple 3D
solid modelling to create 3D bodies. It includes dialogues to control
attributes like texture, colour, reflectance, opacity, etc.
<P>
The <em>audio editor</em> offers facilities to ``cut'' and ``paste''
audio tracks, apply (possibly user-specified) filters on the sound
tracks, and modify their characteristics. A MIDI editor will
also be available.
<P>
The <em>video editor</em> offers similar facilities that of the
audio editor: ``cut'' and ``paste'' of video sequences, modification of its
characteristics (if the underlying hardware permits it), retrieve and
frames as images, etc.
<P>
A separate <em>animation editor</em> is also provided, which allows for
the interactive creation and editing of animation curves, and animation
scripts.
<P>
Note that, under MS-WINDOWS, Microsoft's Multimedia Environment already
contains some multimedia editors; to avoid duplication, these editors
will be reused as much as possible.
