In a somewhat unexpected way, activities in the MADE project have
become very much relevant recently for an ongoing standardization
process within ISO.  Indeed, after several years of preparations, the
ISO committee ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 24 (the committee which developed
graphics standards in the past) has decided to engage into a project for
the standardization of a presentation environment for multimedia
programming. The scope and purposes of this new project, called
PREMO<A HREF=bibliography3_8.html#PREMO>[15]</A> are indeed very close to the project specifications
of MADE: an object-oriented presentation environment for multimedia
objects, including graphics, video, audio, etc., which incorporates
specific means for the synchronization, interaction, and combination of
such media.
<P>
Fortunately for the MADE project (and, hopefully, for the PREMO
project, too), contacts between MADE project members and the relevant
ISO committee could be set up very quickly, due to some earlier ISO
activities of several participants of the MADE project. Concepts
developed within the MADE project have been included into the PREMO
activities, and, conversely, some of the issues that have arisen at the
PREMO meetings have provided valuable input in the design work of
MADE. It can be expected that this fruitful interaction will help to
shape the outcome of the MADE project in the future, too.
