The MADE utility workpackage also includes the definition and
implementation of a user interface builder utility for UNIX
platforms. This utility is based on an existing Bull product called EGERIA<A HREF=bibliography3_8.html#EGERIA>[4]</A> which is to be adapted for the MADE environment
in the course of the project. This utility is considered as a completely
separate part of the MADE environment; it is aimed at the fast
specification of the user-interface part of a MADE application and is
based on the Motif toolkit.
<P>
On MS-WINDOWS environments, Visual C++<A HREF=bibliography3_8.html#VISUALC>[22]</A> will be used as a
user interface builder.  For the integration of MADE objects and
utilities, subclasses of the ``Microsoft Foundation Classes'' will be
developed and accessible directly from Visual C++. This has already been
validated with the 2D editors of GoPATH<A HREF=bibliography3_8.html#JD91>[7]</A>.
<P>
User interface builders may also be available for the scripting
languages usable with MADE. In fact, EGERIA is based on
Wool, and can therefore be used as a user interface generator for
Wool-based applications; a similar development (being carried out
independently of the MADE project) for Python may be used in
later stages of the project.
