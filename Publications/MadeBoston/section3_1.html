One of the most significant developments in computing technology over
the past few years is the emergence of multimedia.  Glossy multimedia
applications are shown all over the place and on a wide range of
different platforms. All major workstation hardware vendors feel the
need to come to technical fairs with stunning demonstrations mixing
graphics, video, imaging, and sound. Technical analysts predict that
multimedia related hardware development will be one of the booming areas
of electronics in the years to come.
<P>
However, most of the available multimedia environments aim at <em>hypermedia authoring</em>, ie, they offer means to interactively create
hypermedia documents.  ``Document'', as a multimedia term, means more
than our traditional paper-based understanding. It should be perceived
as a potentially complex composition of related media information, thus
it is a multimedia document, which can be ``read'' or viewed in a
non-sequential fashion by following semantic connections (or links)
between the various media components, hence it is hypermedia.
<P>
Although the concept of hypermedia document is very powerful indeed, it
does not cover all possible fields of applications of multimedia. The
ability of combining, modifying, or even synthectically creating
multimedia data is often necessary for more complex multimedia
applications. For example, the user might want to extract a frame from a
video sequence, modify it with standard image processing tools, combine
the image with the output of synthetic graphics, and possibly exchange
the original frame with the modified image. Description of such actions
does not fit easily in the model of a hypermedia document, in spite of
the sophisticated interaction tools which are usually provided with
authoring environments. There is, therefore, a need for a programming
environment which would allow for the developments of such applications,
too.
<P>
The techniques to achieve combination of media are extremely disparate,
and they use the results of various fields of computing technology like,
for example, high quality synthetic graphics, image processing, speech
synthesis, etc. Some of the techniques are also highly application
dependent. It is almost impossible to define a closed programming
environment which would encompass all needs. The already traditional
answer to this kind of challenge is to use object-oriented techniques:
services are offered in the form of objects, which are then extensible
by the programmer to include any necessary application-dependent tools.
<P>
The European Communities' ESPRIT III project MADE (Multimedia
Application Development Environment<A HREF=bibliography3_8.html#MADE92>[16]</A>) has set up the
ambitious goal of defining and implementing such a portable
object-oriented development environment for multimedia applications,
based on C++<A HREF=bibliography3_8.html#BS91>[28]</A>. The outcome of the MADE project should be
a programming environment running on various UNIX platforms, as well
as on MS-DOS or Windows-NT environments.  This report gives a general
overview of MADE. It describes its major services, and it also gives
an overview of some possible ``application scenarios'', ie, major
application architectures which may use these services.  It is not the
purpose of the paper to give a detailed technical description of the
full project; this would go far beyond the scope of such a report. The
interested reader should consult the ``official'' MADE documents to
gain a more detailed insight
(eg, <A HREF=bibliography3_8.html#MADE92>[16]</A><A HREF=bibliography3_8.html#MADECOO>[30]</A><A HREF=bibliography3_8.html#MADEScr>[10]</A><A HREF=bibliography3_8.html#MADEPRS>[9]</A><A HREF=bibliography3_8.html#MADETTO>[8]</A><A HREF=bibliography3_8.html#MADETOM>[2]</A>).
<P>
The MADE project is still an ongoing activity. Consequently, some
problems are still open and will be solved only later in the project.
For this reason this report sometimes raises issues without presenting
complete solutions.
