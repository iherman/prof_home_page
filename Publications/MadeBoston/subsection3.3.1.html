<P>
The  MADE toolkit includes <em> media objects</em>, ie,
objects whose role is to directly control different media in a unified
and hardware/firmware independent way.
<P>
The toolkit includes four main categories of media objects: graphics
objects (for two and three dimensional graphics), animation, sound and
video objects.  The functionality of these objects is defined in a
device--independent way; porting the toolkit to a new environment
involves changes on the interface level only. In other words, all of
these objects ``hide'' their respective device--dependencies behind
specific, low--level abstract interface objects, thereby cleanly
separating their  MADE specific behaviour from particular device
dependent features.  Adaptation of a media object type to a new
environment simply requires the definition of a new device--dependent
subclass of the appropriate general interface object.
<P>
Some of the categories listed above contain relatively simple objects.
Their task is to provide a mapping from the  MADE library structure
onto their respective interface object. This is the case, for example,
with video and audio objects. The most critical aspect of the definition
of these objects is synchronization. The objects and their device
specific interfaces must be matched with the synchronization model of
 MADE (see &#167;<A HREF=subsubsection3.3.2.3.html#secsynchronization>3.2.3</A> below) and with the
requirements and facilities provided be the specific hardware that is
used.
<P>
Audio and video objects rely on Microsoft's Multimedia Environment for
 MS--WINDOWS, which is a de--facto standard in this area.  On  UNIX,
portable video and audio services are used: the Video Extension of the X
Windows system for analogue video (<A HREF=bibliography3.8.html#X11Xv>[5]</A>) and the AudioFile
server for audio (<A HREF=bibliography3.8.html#AF>[19]</A>). For digital video, the  UNIX solution is
not yet defined.
<P>
2D and 3D graphics require a much higher level of complexity. Indeed,
the collections of both the 2D and the 3D graphics objects represent two
full--blown subsystems per se, which are also usable stand alone for
graphics purposes.
<P>
For 2D graphics, the  MADE toolkit reuses an already existing
object--oriented 2D graphics system, called GoPATH<A HREF=bibliography3.8.html#JD91>[7]</A>, by
adapting it to the requirements of  MADE. These 2D objects include
different two dimensional shapes, associated clipping areas, composition
rules, attributes (eg, colour, line type, text font), etc. The
programmer has the possibility, via sub--classing, to define new
shapes and include these into the full 2D world. GoPATH is currently
based on X11R5 for  UNIX platforms, and on  MS--WINDOWS under  MS--DOS; a
Windows--NT version is also operational.
<P>
The 3D subsystem provided by  MADE supports a mapping between general
3D objects (shapes, surfaces, lighting and view control, etc.) and
existing 3D packages. A mapping to SGI's GL library is currently being
developed.  The use of PEX<A HREF=bibliography3.8.html#WCJIMCJS88>[6]</A> or Open-GL, as a replacement
for GL, will be considered in the future.  It has to be stressed that it
is <em> not</em> the goal of the  MADE development to define yet another
three dimensional graphics package; the emphasis is more to provide an
object--oriented layer on top of existing packages, integrated into the
 MADE environment. On the other hand, due to the object--oriented
nature of the  MADE toolkit, it is possible to extend, by
sub--classing, the basic 3D functionality (eg, to add a proprietary
ray--tracing module).
<P>
Graphics objects (both in 2D and 3D) do not have a temporal dimension;
essentially, they describe static scenes. This is in contrast with the
inherently temporal nature of video and audio objects.  To alleviate
this contradiction,  MADE includes separate <em> animation objects</em>,
which describe, and even automatically generate, sequences of scenes.
The methods and algorithms used in animation may be extremely complex
and, more importantly, dependent on specific application areas.
Although simpler, built--in animation techniques based on animation
curves are also available,  MADE animation objects also allow for
animation scripts, using a scripting language, which is then interpreted
by the  MADE animation objects.
<P>
Animation objects may be active objects, too, thereby subject to the
same synchronization behaviour and control as audio and video objects
(see &#167;<A HREF=subsubsection3.3.2.3.html#secsynchronization>3.2.3</A>).
