The importance of <em> structuring</em>, ie, of creating aggregates of
different objects in interactive programs, has long been recognized in
computer graphics.  All graphics packages provide some form of
aggregation, like structures in  PHIGS<A HREF=bibliography3.8.html#TLJHWTHRJHKMW91>[12]</A>,
the scene database of IRIS Inventor<A HREF=bibliography3.8.html#PSSRC92>[27]</A>, or the so called
Go trees in GoPATH<A HREF=bibliography3.8.html#JD91>[7]</A>.  Although the structures used in these
examples are all relatively simple (directed acyclic graphs or just
trees), the appearance of hypertext and, lately, of hypermedia systems
makes it clear that more general aggregation facilities are also
necessary.
<P>
To answer these demands, the  MADE toolkit includes a general graph
management facility in the form of <em> graph objects</em>. These objects
allow for the specification, management, and the traversal of general
graphs, with no restrictions imposed on their types. Nodes of these
graphs may refer to any  MADE object. Graph management is achieved via
special  MADE objects; consequently, recursive graphs may also be
defined via the same mechanism. Individual  MADE objects can be
referred to by several graph nodes (ie, they can be <em> shared</em>).
<P>
Graph objects provide a sound basis for the type of structuring required
by graphics as well as for complex hypermedia navigation systems. They
are fully integrated into the full  MADE structure, which has a number
of advantages. As an example, graphs provide an automatic defence
against concurrent access of structures by active objects, they can be
exported and imported using the very same mechanism as for all other
 MADE objects (ie, complete structures may be stored in databases),
etc.
