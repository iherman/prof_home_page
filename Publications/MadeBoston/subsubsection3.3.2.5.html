<P>
Provision of a general purpose constraint system within  MADE for all
of the potential uses of constraints in a multimedia development
environment would justify a development project in its own right.
Fortunately, there are various restricted types of constraint satisfier
that, while not being as capable in some aspects, still provide useful
functionality for dealing with certain categories of constraint.
<P>
The approach followed in the specification of constraints within  MADE
(see also <A HREF=bibliography3.8.html#MADECOO>[30]</A>), is to consider those applications of
constraint systems that are of direct relevance to the multimedia part
of  MADE. In effect, this restricts the scope of the constraint
satisfier to the topics of geometric layout, user interface control,
animation, and media synchronisation.  For example, the  MADE
presentation facilities include a composition editor/player which may
make use of constraints when defining the hypermedia document structure
and presentation characteristics.  What this classification means is
that any predefined constraints that are defined as part of the toolkit
can be organised into ``constraint families'' (to avoid the use of the
term ``class'') which are relevant for specific multimedia aspects.
<P>
For the time being at least, only one--way constraints are proposed for
 MADE. While multi--way constraints provide greater expressive power to
the constraint user, they also require more complex constraint
satisfaction algorithms and may involve more effort on the part of the
programmer to set up specific constraint objects. This decision need not
be considered final, and can be reviewed after experience with the
proposed constraint objects has been gained.
